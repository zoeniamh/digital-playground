    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.
      </li>

      const article = `It was the trees, who, despite their protests to Aureliaâ€™s presence, were the first to alert her of the arrival of someone new. The leaves began to clash together as the winds returned, pushing the mangled branches together. The entire forest began to groan. This newcomer was not a friend. Aurelia let herself down off her perch, landing in the now knee-deep water. She let her dress go, not caring if it got wet, as the ocean rapidly rose out from beneath the soil, begging her home. She would have to ignore it today. Her oldest confidant no longer had her best interest at heart, this she knew. Aurelia turned to face their guest. `;
